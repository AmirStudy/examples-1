# urbandict-search


In this demo, we use Jina to build a vocabulary search engine so that one can find a word if s/he only knows the definition. We use the [urban-dictionary-words-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/urban-dictionary-words-dataset) from kaggle. The data contains 1.7 million entries from Urban Dictionary with definations and votes. In the urbandict data, each word has one or more definitions. Therefore we consider a word and its definition as one **document**, and each sentence in the definition as one **chunk**. If you are not familiar with these concepts, we highly suggest to go through our lovely [Jina 101](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/tree/master/docs/chapters/101) and [Jina "Hello, World!"üëãüåç](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina#jina-hello-world-) before moving forward. 

As the same as build classic search engines, we first build an index for all the documents (i.e. the words and their definitions from the urban dictionary) and later use the query document (i.e. the user's input definition) to retrieve the indexed documents.


## Overview

Before dashing into the codes, let's have an overview of the magic. The goal is to enable to find the word if you only know the defintion. To make this happen, we consider each sentence in the words' definition as a chunk, which is the minimal semantical unit in Jina. Specially, each word can be explained with a few sentences. And each sentence, as a chunk, is encoded into a vector with the help of the **Encoder** (i.e. we use the `DistilBert` from the `transformer` lib). 

During indexing, Jina, _the_ neural search framework, uses vectors to represent the words and save the vectors in the index. During querying, having only the definition from the user's input, we encode the input into vectors with the same **Encoder**. So that, these query vectors can be used to retrieve the indexed words with similiar definitions back.


## Prerequirements

This demo requires Python 3.7.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Prepare the data

The raw urbandict data contains 2.5 million entries in the `.csv` format as following.

```
word_id,word,up_votes,down_votes,author,definition
0000007,Janky,296,255,dc397b2f,"Undesirable; less-than optimum."
```

Please download the `urban-dictionary-words-dataset.zip` from
[https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/urban-dictionary-words-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/urban-dictionary-words-dataset) and saved at `/tmp`. 

After downloading, run the following script to do some data wrangling before indexing. We use the uncased words and drop the definitions with few up-votes. In total, 744,676 words are kept with 1,112,851 definitions. The processed data is kept in `/tmp/jina/urbandict/urbandict-word-defs.json`. 

```bash
python prepare_data.py
```


## Define the index Flow
To index the data we first need to define our **Flow**. Here we use **YAML** file to define the Flow. In the Flow YAML file, we add **Pods** in sequence. In this demo, we have 5 pods defined with the name of `splittor`, `encoder`, `chunk_indexer`, `doc_indexer`, and `join_all`. 

However, we have another Pod working in silent. Actually, the input to the very first Pod is always the Pod with the name of **gateway**, the Forgotten Pod. For most time, we can safely ignore the **gateway** because it basically do the dirty orchestration work for the Flow.

By default, the input of each Pod is the Pod defined right above it, and the request message flows from one Pod to another. That how Flow lives up to its name. Of course, you might want to have a Pod skipping or jump over the above Pods. In this case, you will use the `needs` argument to specify the source of the input messages. In our case, the `doc_indexer` actually get inputs directly from the `gateway`. By doing this, we have two pathways in parallel as shown in the index Flow diagram.

As we can see, for most Pods, we only need to define the YAML file path. Given the YAML files, jina will automatically build the Pods. Plus, `timeout_ready` is a useful argument when adding a Pod, which defines the waiting time before the Flow considers the Pod fails to initialize. You might also notice the `join_all` Pod has a special YAML path. It denotes a built-in YAML path, which will merge all the incoming messages defined in `needs`.

Overall, the index Flow has two pathways, as shown in the Flow diagram. The idea is to save the index and the contents seperately so that one can quickly retrieve the Document Ids from the index and afterwards combine the Document Id with its content. 

The pathway on the right side with single `doc_indexer` is used to storage the Document content. Underhood it is basically a key-value storage. The key is the Document Id and the value is the Document itself.

The pathway on the other side is for saving the index. From top to bottom, the first Pod, `splitter`, is used to split the Document into Chunks, which are the basic units to process in jina. Chunks are later encoded into vectors by the `encoder`. These vectors together with other informations in the Chunks are saved in a vector storage by `chunk_indexer`. Finally, the two pathway are merged by `join_all` and the processing of one message is concluded.

As in the indexing time, we also need a Flow to process the request message during querying. Here we start with the `splittor` sharing exactly the same YAML with its conterpart in the index Flow. This means it plays the same role as before, which is to split the Document into Chunks. Afterwards, the Chunks are encoded into vectors by `encoder`, and later these vectors are used to retrieve the indexed Chunks by `chunk_indexer`. As the same as the `splitter`, both `encoder` and `chunk_indexer` share the YAML with their counterparts in the index Flow. 

Eventually, here comes a new Pod with the name of `ranker`. Remember that Chunks are the basic units in jina. In the deep core of jina, both indexing and quering take place at the Chunk level. Chunks are the elements the the jina core can understand and process. However, we need to ship the final query results in the form of Document, which are actually meaningful for the users. This is exactly the job of `ranker`. `ranker` combines the querying results from the Chunk level into the Document level. In this demo, we use the built-in `BM25Ranker` to do the job. It uses the BM25 algorithm to get the weights of query Chunks, and calculates the weights sum of the Chunks' matching scores as the score of the matched Document. For the details, please refer to the jina document page. 

At the last step, the `doc_indexer` comes into play. Sharing the same YAML file, `doc_indexer` will load the storaged key-value index and retrieve the matched Documents back according the Document Id.

Now we've both index and query Flows ready to work. Before proceeding forward, please note differences between the index and the query Flow. Obviously, they have different structure, although they share most Pods. This is a common practice in the jina world for the consideration of speed. Except the `ranker`, both Flow can indeed use the identical structure. The two-pathway design of the index Flow is intended to speed up the message passing, because indexing the Chunks and the Documents can be done in paralle. Another import difference is that the two Flows are used to process different types of request messages. To index a Document, we send an **IndexRequest** to the Flow. While querying, we send a **SearchRequest**. That's why the Pods in both Flows can share the YAML files while playing different roles. Later, we will dive deep into into the YAML files, where we define the different ways of processing messages of various types.


## Run the Flows

### Index 

With the Flows, we now can write the codes to run the Flow. For indexing, we start with defining the Flow with YAML file. Afterwards, the `build()` function will do the magic to construct Pods and connect them together. Then the `IndexRequest` will be sent to the flow by calling the `index()` function. The content of the `IndexRequest` is fed from the `read_data()`, which loads the processed JSON file and output each word together with its defintion in `bytes` format.
Encoding the text with bert-family models will take a long time. To save your time, here we limit the number of indexing documents to 10000.
 
```bash
python app.py -t index -n 10000
```

```python
def read_data(fn, max_sample_size=1000):
    with open(fn, 'r') as f:
        data_dict = json.load(f)
        for r in data_dict[:max_sample_size]:
            word = r['word'].lower()
            def_text = r['text'].lower()
            yield '{}: {}'.format(word, def_text).encode('utf8')

         
def main(num_docs):
    flow = Flow().load_config('flow-index.yml')
    with flow.build() as fl:
    	 data_fn = os.path.join('/tmp/jina/urbandict', "urbandict-word-defs.json")
        fl.index(raw_bytes=read_data(data_fn, num_docs))

```

### Query
As for the query part, we follow the same story to define and build the Flow from the YAML file. The `search()` function is used to send a `SearchRequest` to the Flow. Here we accept the user query inputs from the terminal and wrap it into request message in the `bytes` format. 

The `callback` argument is used to post-process the returned message. In this demo, we define a simple `print_topk` function to show the results. The returned message `resp` in a protobuf message. `resp.search.docs` contains all the Documents for searching, and in our case there is only one Document. For each query Document, the matched Documents, `.match_doc`, together with the matching score, `.score`, are storaged under the `.topk_results` as a repeated variable.
```bash
python app.py -t query
```

```python
def read_query_data(text):
    yield '{}'.format(text).encode('utf8')

def print_topk(resp, word):
    for d in resp.search.docs:
        print(f'Ta-DahüîÆ, here are what we found for: {word}')
        for idx, kk in enumerate(d.topk_results):
            score = kk.score.value
            if score <= 0.0:
                continue
            print('{:>2d}:({:f}):{}'.format(
                idx, score, kk.match_doc.raw_bytes.decode()))       

def main(top_k):
    flow = Flow().load_config('flow-query.yml')
    with flow.build() as fl:
        while True:
            text = input('word definition: ')
            if not text:
                break
            ppr = lambda x: print_topk(x, text)
            fl.search(read_query_data(text), callback=ppr, topk=top_k)
```
